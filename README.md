run the following commands in command line:</br>
 &emsp;npm install</br>
 &emsp;npm start</br>
Then the app will be running on http://localhost:3000<br>

What I implement:</br>
    &emsp;1. Basic requirements</br>
    &emsp;2. Single player: </br>
      &emsp;&emsp;Two difficulty levels: easy and hard mode<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;Tracking player's scores and dislay</br>
      &emsp;&emsp;Tracking Best Score and store it locally</br>
      &emsp;&emsp;Tracking time. Use a countdown timer. If time runs out, the player lose</br>
    &emsp;3. Two players:</br>
      &emsp;&emsp;Tracking two players' own scores</br>
      &emsp;&emsp;Judge who wins in the end</br>
