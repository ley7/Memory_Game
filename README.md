run the following command in command line:
  npm install
  npm start
Then the app will be running on http://localhost:3000

What I implement:
    1. Basic requirements
    2. Single player: 
      Two difficulty levels: easy and hard mode
      Tracking player's scores and dislay
      Tracking Best Score and store it locally
      Tracking time. Use a countdown timer. If time runs out, the player lose
    3. Two players:
      Tracking two players' own scores
      Judge who wins in the end
